#### Brief Description of Project - Dakma Institute is an educational institute in Deiyandara. They required an online tutoring management system for their institute, as it was unable to carry out the institute physically because of the current economic crisis and the prevailing covid situation in the country. Currently, the institute is issuing cards for the students when enrolling and the student details are kept in books. Tutors are providing printed tutorials and exam papers for students. Also, institute notices and class schedules are displayed on a notice board and issues of the students are addressed at the reception. The client identified this method is not effective.

The client needed the system to be faster, more productive, cost-effective, and trackable. This system is designed to meet the above requirements which could manage users, tutorials, classes, financial information, schedules, and support students within the organization. Within this system, Students and tutors could register to the system and their details will be stored in the system database, and students could enroll in their desired classes. Students could make their payments through the online payment gateway and attend lectures. Tutors can upload necessary tutorials and exams for the Learning Management System and students can download them. The class schedules and institute notices are also displayed in the system and a student support desk is introduced to discuss student issues. Therefore, this approach will be beneficial for the client, tutors as well as the students.
